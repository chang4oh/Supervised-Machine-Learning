# Supervised Machine Learning
<br>I will be using three csv files to go through data preprocessing, EDA, and MLA
<br>
<br>Supervised ML divides into two categories: classification and regression
<br>Classification are object aka strings that are classified into categories
<br>Classification will need to transform string into numerical using one-hpt-encoder 
<br>or get_dummies with extra column removal to prevent future errors
<br>great use for color prediction, weather forecast, personal decision making
<br>Algorithms: LogReg, SVM Class, KNN Class, Decision Tree Class, Random Forest Class
<br>
<br>Regression are continuous numerical that predicts output based on features
<br>great use for predicting property values including homes and vehicles
<br>Algorithms: LinReg, SVM Reg, KNN Reg, Decision Tree Reg, Random Forest Reg
