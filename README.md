# Supervised Machine Learning
<br>I will be using three csv files to go through data preprocessing, EDA, and MLA
<br>
<br>Supervised ML divides into two categories: classification and regression
<br>Classification are object aka strings that are classified into categories with % probability output
<br>Classification will need to transform string into numerical using one-hpt-encoder 
<br>or get_dummies with extra column removal to prevent future errors
<br>great use for color prediction, weather forecast, personal decision making
<br>Algorithms that are used are: K-Nearest Neighbors classifier, Logistic regression, decision tree classifier,
<br>support vector classifier (SVC)
<br>
<br>Regression are continuous numerical that predicts output based on features
<br>great use for predicting property values including homes and vehicles
<br>Algorithms that are used are: K-Nearest Neigbhors regressor, Linear regression, decision tree regressor,
<br>support vector machine (SVM)
<br>
<br>Generally KNN classifer, Linear Regression, decision tree classifier, and support vector machine are used often
<br>As it derive the output with optimal performance 
<br>
<br>KNN will also be used in clustering mentioned in Unsupervised Machine Learning project
<br>and will become semi-supervised because KNN has target y feature while clustering
